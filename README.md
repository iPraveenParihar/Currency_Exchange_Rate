# College_Activity
A simple Currency Exchange-Rate Python program for over 150+ world currencies.

# Introduction
In finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another. It is also regarded as the value of one country’s currency in relation to another currency. 
Objective
Exchange rates are much important even for a small scale business.
As exchange rates go up and down, it might be a difficult task for a company to monitor rates so that it will be in their favour.
A simple Application/Program can be built so that users can monitor exchange rates.


#Scope
Exchange Rate is a program made to get latest exchange rate of a currency.
It is a CLI (Command Line Interface) wherein users can get list of all world currencies, exchange rates. So program can be invoked from the terminal and display exchange rates of user choice. Exchange Rates are fetched from website www.openexchangerates.org using API service. For fetching latest data user must have an active internet connection this is the basic requirement of the program.
•	All exchange rates are with respect to USD(US Dollar)
•	User get a list of 150+ world currencies
•	For full time access to exchange rates subscription is needed from openexchangerates 


# Abstract
We are solving the above mentioned problem (Exchange Rate) using Python Programming language and later implementing the same in bash script.
To get real-time Exchange Rates we are making use of API (from openexchangerates.org). So to fetch the real-time rates user need to have active internet connection.
For data, API key is needed which is provided openexchangerates 
Upon signup.


# Requirement Specification
•	Python3 Installed
•	Python Libraries(JSON)


# Limitations
•	User gets exchange rates for limited time
•	Required Active Internet for latest data.
•	It is based on Command Line Interface.
