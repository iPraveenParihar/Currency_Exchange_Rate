Upon signup.


## Requirement Specification
•	Python3 Installed <br />
•	Python Libraries(JSON)


## Limitations
•	User gets exchange rates for limited time <br />
•	Required Active Internet for latest data. <br />
•	It is based on Command Line Interface.


## Modification
- User can use his own API key by signing up [here] (www.openexchangerates.org) <br /> You get  1000 free API calls. <br />
